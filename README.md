# CERN-SHiP-strawtube-studies

Work done during the summer student programme 2017 at CERN. 

This repository contains the working code and all the intermediate scripts I used during my internship at CERN in Geneva.
It was used to undertake studies concerning the straw tracker for the SHiP (Search For Hidden Particles) Experiment at the CERN North area.
